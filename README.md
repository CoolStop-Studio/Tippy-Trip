### 📖 Storyline:

You're going on a camping trip to Lake Windy, but it seems you've overpacked. You don't have any space left in your RV, so you decide to pile the rest of your items on the roof. But uh oh, it's a little bit of a bumpy ride. Drive carefully so your belongings don't fall!

### 🔎 Description:

Drive through an infinite, procedurally generated world full of hilly terrain and a scenic background. Balance the luggage on top of your car and avoid tipping over as you steer around dangerous peaks, hills, and valleys. In this 2D sides roller, your goal is to get as far as possible before you tip over!
